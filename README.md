# Recipe-Search
- A tool written in Python3 with an GUI made with Tkinter used to search for food recipes using Spoonacular API 
- Running the program will open a new window with a lot of filters that can help the user search for a specific recipe. After that a list will apear from which the user has to type/choose what he's looking for. After that a new window will apear with the ingredients and steps in order to prepare the recipe. Also using the image viewer the user can browse how the recipes found look and also how the ingredients look. 
- The tool also provides the user with a subtitute search field that can be used to look for an alternative to a certain ingredient.
- Read the release to find more information about how it looks like and how to use.
# Save Your Money
## Project Description
This is a web application I made in order to keep track of how I'm spending money and how much can I save each month. It's a Python web app that uses Flask for authentication and database management. I used BS4 as HTML and CSS framework for the looks of the web app, a bit of jinja and a bit of JS. For piecharts I used the Google Charts tools.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download it from GitHub.
2. Open your Terminal of choice and navigate to the repository's folder.
3. Make sure Python3 is installed.
4. Make sure to subscribe to Spoonacular API (I used RapidAPI platform) and save the key and host.
5. Start the application 
```markdown
python3 recipe_search.py
```
6. Insert the key and host in the respective fields to be able to access the API.
5. HF!
