# Recipe-Search
A tool written in Python3 with an GUI made with Tkinter used to search for food recipes. Running the program will open a new window with a lot of filters that can help the user search for a specific recipe. After that a list will apear from which the user has to type/choose what he's looking for. After that a new window will apear with the ingredients and steps in order to prepare the recipe. Also using the image viewer the user can browse how the recipes found look and also how the ingredients look. The tool also provides the user with a subtitute search field that can be used to look for an alternative to a certain ingredient.
Before running the program make sure to subscribe to Spoonacular API (I used RapidAPI platform) and insert the key and host in the respective fields to be able to access the API.
